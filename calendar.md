Readings are due – meaning they should be completed – on the dates indicated.

The most accurate and up-to-date version of this calendar can be found on this course site. Use this calendar to check on reading assignments, rather than the print version, since the print version of this syllabus will not be updated throughout the semester.

I reserve the right to change the course calendar as needed; adequate advance notice will always be given of any changes.

BB indicates that reading can be found on our Blackboard site on the “Readings” page.
